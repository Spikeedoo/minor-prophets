The book of Joel records Judah\'s response to the giant locust plague that devastated the nation.  This plague caused great suffering as crops served as the backbone of the Jewish economy, were the offerings used for worship, and were part of the pastures for the animals.  Joel uses this event as a way to get through to the people--something much worse was on its way.","prophet_bio_2":"One noteworthy fact about the book of Joel is that it uses the phrase \\"The day of the Lord\\" more than any other prophetic book.  This future day serves as the real reason for Joel\'s warnings.  The destruction the locust brought about was a call to repent for God\'s people, since the day of the Lord would bring about a much harsher judgment on Israel and Judah for violating their covenant with Him.  Finally, Joel promises everlasting security, protection, and pardon for Israel\'s wrongs if they are willing to turn from their ways.","timeframe":"~ Unknown Dates ~","key_verse":"\\"Yet even now,\\" declares the Lord, \\"return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments.\\"  Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster.","key_verse_ref":"Joel 2:12-13"}')},27:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Amos","headshot_url":"/img/amos.jpg","pic_url":"/img/tekoa.jpg","pic_cap":"Pictured: Tekoa, Judah (Amos\'s birth place)","prophet_bio_1":"Born in Tekoa, Judah, the Prophet Amos was a farmer and herder that was sent by God to warn the Northern Kingdom.  He was known as a \\"nipper of sycamore figs\\"-- a nod to what kind of agricultural work he took part in.  With no formal religious credentials or training, Amos is another reminder that God chose some of the least expected people to do some of His most important work.","prophet_bio_2":"Amos, one of the first Minor Prophets, was a contemporary of Hosea.  This meant he lived during the time of great economic prosperity that had corrupted Israel.  Through the words of judgment for Israel and the surrounding nations and the visions from God he documented, Amos displayed God\'s concern for justice for the poor and unfortunate and the inevitability of His impending action.  One important thing to draw from the book of Amos is that he did not only make the day of the Lord known to the people--he corrected their understanding of it.  Not only were God\'s people in violation of His covenant, they believed the day of judgment would be a day of great prosperity and blessing.  Amos warned them otherwise.","timeframe":"~ approx. 750 B.C. ~","key_verse":"Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord!  Why would you have the day of the Lord?

The name Obadiah, a common one in the days of the Old Testament, means \\"Servant of Yahweh\\", but there is really nothing else known about him.  Obadiah may have served as one of the earliest minor prophets, but more likely some time around the 586 B.C. Babylonian conquest of Israel.","prophet_bio_2":"The book of Obadiah was written to address the Edomites and encourage Judah.  At that point, Edom and Judah, while technically related nations by lineage, were bitter rivals.  Judah was being crushed by some outside nation (hence the date dispute--if we knew who attacked them we could figure out what point in history this was) and Edom saw this as an opportunity to take advantage of them.  Obadiah\'s prophecy is largely a warning to Edom of God\'s demand for civility between these two hostile nations.  The book discusses the Day of the Lord, a moment in which the situation would be reversed: Edom being destroyed and Judah being restored.  Throughout history, this grim prediction came to be true.  While the land Edom used to possess still exists, the Edomites have been completely wiped out.  This is a powerful thing to grasp when contrasted with the over 6 million Jews that are alive today.","timeframe":"~ Unknown Dates ~","key_verse":"Behold, I will make you small among the nations; you shall be utterly despised.
