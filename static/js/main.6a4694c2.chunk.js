The book of Joel records Judah\'s response to the giant locust plague that devastated the nation.  This plague caused great suffering as crops served as the backbone of the Jewish economy, were the offerings used for worship, and were part of the pastures for the animals.  Joel uses this event as a way to get through to the people--something much worse was on its way.","prophet_bio_2":"One noteworthy fact about the book of Joel is that it uses the phrase \\"The day of the Lord\\" more than any other prophetic book.  This future day serves as the real reason for Joel\'s warnings.  The destruction the locust brought about was a call to repent for God\'s people, since the day of the Lord would bring about a much harsher judgment on Israel and Judah for violating their covenant with Him.  Finally, Joel promises everlasting security, protection, and pardon for Israel\'s wrongs if they are willing to turn from their ways.","timeframe":"~ Unknown Dates ~","key_verse":"\\"Yet even now,\\" declares the Lord, \\"return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments.\\"  Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster.","key_verse_ref":"Joel 2:12-13"}')},27:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Amos","headshot_url":"/img/amos.jpg","pic_url":"/img/tekoa.jpg","pic_cap":"Pictured: Tekoa, Judah (Amos\'s birth place)","prophet_bio_1":"Born in Tekoa, Judah, the Prophet Amos was a farmer and herder that was sent by God to warn the Northern Kingdom.  He was known as a \\"nipper of sycamore figs\\"-- a nod to what kind of agricultural work he took part in.  With no formal religious credentials or training, Amos is another reminder that God chose some of the least expected people to do some of His most important work.","prophet_bio_2":"Amos, one of the first Minor Prophets, was a contemporary of Hosea.  This meant he lived during the time of great economic prosperity that had corrupted Israel.  Through the words of judgment for Israel and the surrounding nations and the visions from God he documented, Amos displayed God\'s concern for justice for the poor and unfortunate and the inevitability of His impending action.  One important thing to draw from the book of Amos is that he did not only make the day of the Lord known to the people--he corrected their understanding of it.  Not only were God\'s people in violation of His covenant, they believed the day of judgment would be a day of great prosperity and blessing.  Amos warned them otherwise.","timeframe":"~ approx. 750 B.C. ~","key_verse":"Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord!  Why would you have the day of the Lord?

The name Obadiah, a common one in the days of the Old Testament, means \\"Servant of Yahweh\\", but there is really nothing else known about him.  Obadiah may have served as one of the earliest minor prophets, but more likely some time around the 586 B.C. Babylonian conquest of Israel.","prophet_bio_2":"The book of Obadiah was written to address the Edomites and encourage Judah.  At that point, Edom and Judah, while technically related nations by lineage, were bitter rivals.  Judah was being crushed by some outside nation (hence the date dispute--if we knew who attacked them we could figure out what point in history this was) and Edom saw this as an opportunity to take advantage of them.  Obadiah\'s prophecy is largely a warning to Edom of God\'s demand for civility between these two hostile nations.  The book discusses the Day of the Lord, a moment in which the situation would be reversed: Edom being destroyed and Judah being restored.  Throughout history, this grim prediction came to be true.  While the land Edom used to possess still exists, the Edomites have been completely wiped out.  This is a powerful thing to grasp when contrasted with the over 6 million Jews that are alive today.","timeframe":"~ Unknown Dates ~","key_verse":"Behold, I will make you small among the nations; you shall be utterly despised.

For one, it was said that Jonah was born in Gath-Hepher in Galilee.  Second, his ministry appeared to be during the time of Jeroboam II\'s reign which was sometime around 793-753 B.C.  This period was characterized as being a low point for Assyria as it was after their initial growth in the region but before they conquered Israel.","prophet_bio_2":"The book of Jonah is not like many of the other prophetic books in the Bible.  While it is a point of debate whether the book is fiction or nonfiction, one thing is for sure--the book has a lot of allegorical value.  Jonah disobeys God\'s command to warn Nineveh and tries to sail to Tarsish.  After being thrown overboard and surviving three days in the belly of a whale, Jonah finally carried out his mission.  When the people of Nineveh repented and were saved, however, Jonah was disappointed with the result.  The fact that the section showcasing Jonah\'s poor attitude toward Nineveh\'s response was included may be odd to some, but it appears to serve a large purpose when looking at the book\'s allegorical value.  Jonah, an imperfect prophet that slipped up many times, finally got the job done and appeared to be in the right.  But when it was all over, he could not be satisfied with God extending his forgiveness to the people of Nineveh--even though that very forgiveness gave Jonah a second chance to carry out his mission.","timeframe":"~ approx. 793-753 B.C. ~","key_verse":"Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, \\"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for the evil has come up before me.\\"  But Jonah roes to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.  He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish.

A contemporary of Hosea, Isaiah, and Amos, Micah\'s work came before the fall of Samaria.  One interesting thing to note about his work is that his ministry was used to defend the prophet Jeremiah, a very influential prophet that came after Micah.  Jeremiah\'s sometimes unpopular messages caused him to come under threat of harm, but the people remembered that Micah had warned them of the same things and the king of the time had not tried to stop him.","prophet_bio_2":"Micah came to warn the people of Israel about their wrongdoing through foreshadowing of both judgment and restoration.  This more \\"classic\\" style of prophecy book (when compared to something like Jonah) focused on the social injustice of the time.  These addressed injustices largely consisted of financial scams, religious corruption, and corrupt leadership.  Micah also addressed God\'s desire for sincere worship over insincere religious activity.  Beyond judgment, Micah spent several chapters talking about how God would restore Israel.  A key part of the book consisted of prophesying about the coming Messianic Kingdom, as Micah alluded to Jesus of Bethlehem without mentioning him by name.","timeframe":"~ approx. 737-696 B.C. ~","key_verse":"He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?","key_verse_ref":"Micah 6:8"}')},31:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Nahum"}')},32:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Habakkuk"}')},33:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Zephaniah"}')},34:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Haggai"}')},35:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Zechariah"}')},36:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Malachi"}')},40:function(e,t,o){e.exports=o(104)},45:function(e,t,o){},46:function(e,t,o){},9:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"name":"Hosea","headshot_url":"/img/hosea.jpg","pic_url":"/img/samaria.jpg","pic_cap":"Pictured: Ancient Samaria during the time of Hosea","prophet_bio_1":"The Prophet Hosea\'s work began shortly before the end of Jeroboam II\'s reign.
